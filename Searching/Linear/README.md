## Bubble Sort

In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a particular value in a list that consists of checking every one of its elements, one at a time and in sequence, until the desired one is found.

- Linear search is the simplest search algorithm.
- It is a special case of brute-force search.
- Its worst case cost is proportional to the number of elements in the list.

### Algorithms

```text
1.	Set i = 0

2.	Repeat steps 3 (while i < N)

3.	If A[i] = Value
   Then
	Write i
	GOTO step 5
   Else
	Write “Value is not present in Array”

4.	Set i = i + 1

5.	Exit.

```
